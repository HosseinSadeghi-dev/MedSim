# MedSim

Medsim is a web application built with Angular 16, NestJS, and PostgreSQL. It is designed to help doctors diagnose and treat patients by providing information on various tests, their costs, and the time required for each test.

The application allows doctors to create patient profiles and input their symptoms. Based on the symptoms, the application suggests various tests that can be performed to diagnose the illness. The doctor can then select the tests they want to perform and get an estimate of the cost and time required for each test.

Medsim also provides a database of common illnesses and their treatments. Doctors can search for specific illnesses and get information on the recommended treatment options.

The application is built using Angular 16 for the frontend, NestJS for the backend API, and PostgreSQL as the database. It follows a modular architecture with separate modules for authentication, patient management, test management, illness management, etc.
